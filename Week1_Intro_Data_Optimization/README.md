# Week 1 Organizational Assets Through the Collection and Use of Data

Data mining techniques provide opportunities for the organization to perform daunting tasks within the daily processes. Data mining techniques make it possible for the organization to analyze the condition of the data assets in terms of the reliability and accuracy factors. Data mining techniques provide the organization power in the data world and aid data-miners and other experts to work as one to take data from old databases to hybrid databases that combine all information in one place for the organization.

In general, data mining consists of analyzing data from several different perspectives and then summarizing that information into something useful that could be used to increase revenue or cut costs. The best way to analyze the data is to use data-mining software. This software allows the user to view data from many different angles and dimensions and then categorize and summarize it into its relationships. In a technical sense, data mining is the process of identifying correlations and patterns among many fields in a large database.

Data mining has evolved from data collection in the 1960s, data access in the 1980s, and data warehousing and decision support in the 1990s. Data mining answers the business question: "What is likely to happen in this area during the next month and why?" Faster and cheaper computers with more storage and advanced computer algorithms have made data mining possible today across various industries. Data mining can be used to generate hypotheses about what may occur in the future and why these events may take place. By discovering patterns, organizations can use data mining to make strategic decisions.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
