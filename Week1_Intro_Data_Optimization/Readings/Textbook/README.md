## Chapter 1: What's it all about

The explosion of both data volumes and the dimensionality of records introduces significant challenges to understand and reason about it.  Data mining is the science of finding patterns and exploring the statistical relevance of various assumptions.

There is a need to describe structural patterns to data, such as `which contacts to recommend to a patient` -- if they have poor tear production and are young then soft is better than hard lens.

While there is arguments towards the definition of learning, for the purposes of data mining, we can think of `training` as close enough.  The training explores structural descriptions of what is learned and then expresses rules that best map to those examples.

Anonymization of data does not work as it only takes 2-3 data points to reverse engineer about 85% of America (pg. 33).
