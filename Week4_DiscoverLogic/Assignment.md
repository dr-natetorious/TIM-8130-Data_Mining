# Analyze Techniques to Discover Logic

## Section I: Identify tools that proposed evidence is insufficient

Part 1: This week, you will research and identify ways that data mining tools can help flag data that do not meet logic guidelines for human intervention or review. Begin by identifying two different scenarios that are built into public databases, either through a review of the databases or studying case information about the databases. Next, identify the logic, the scenario, and what happens if the input does not meet logic requirements.

## Section II: Compare predictive techniques and their real-world applications

Part 2: After reading about the other predictive data mining techniques and using the same organization as you have in past assignments, compare the predictive data mining techniques studied to the ones used by the organization. Discuss the similarities that you found. In addition, discuss additional predictive data mining techniques that the organization has used and the reasons for using these techniques for their data. Finally, analyze what types of patterns have been found in their data that has led to key strategic decisions.
