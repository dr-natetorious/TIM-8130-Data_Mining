# Section 3: Week 6: Data Mining Using Statistics

Data mining techniques and statistics are correlated because of what can be learned about the data in both instances. Data mining and statistics involve the discovery and identification of structure in the data and how these can be turned into information. Statistics and data mining overlap in their aims and approaches, so it makes sense to study data mining techniques and statistics together and use them simultaneously in practice.

Data mining and statistics are very closely related. Most of the techniques used in data mining can be categorized into statistical frameworks. There is, however, a fundamental difference in the techniques used in data mining when compared to statistics. It is common for statistical models to make strong assumptions about the data and then, based on the assumptions, make strong statements about the results of the analysis. The problem with this is the assumptions are flawed such that the entire validity of the model can be questioned. In machine learning techniques, especially those used in data mining, the assumptions about the data are weaker. The result is that data mining isnâ€™t able to make strong statements about the results while still producing good results regardless of the data.

Another difference is that traditional statistical methods require a great deal of user interaction to validate the correctness of the model, making the methods difficult to automate. With data mining, there is far less user interaction, making them easier to automate.

Statistics underscore the core of data mining. Without statistical modeling, methodology, and analysis, the data that are generated would be meaningless. The data mining activities create the entire process of data analysis. Statistics are beneficial in aiding the development of patterns what will help to make further predictions from the information. In this course, you can use numerous statistical tools including the tools in the resources, SPSS, SAS, or even Microsoft Excel, which contains current versions with powerful statistical manipulation tools.

Data mining and statistics are important data analysis techniques and help organizations to make more informed and accurate decisions. Statistics are the portion of data mining that provides tools and analytical techniques to handle large amounts of data. Statistics can be seen as the science of learning the data; this process involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, and presenting the data. Statistics center around probabilistic models and inferences using those collected data.

The resources for this week explore the use of statistics in data mining. You will explore statistical modeling in the articles and how organizations use this information in the data analysis process.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
