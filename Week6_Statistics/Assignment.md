# Analyze Statistics in Data Sets and Data Mining

## Instructions

This week select one of the big data sets chosen for you in the course resources. After reviewing the data set information, craft a research question and a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a belief or a starting point that may or may not be valid but can be tested statistically for validity. Sometimes a hypothesis is that something you believe to be true and test to discover if it really is (or is not) true; and other times, it is a completely new way of thinking that you choose to test against what you already know.

Once you have your research question and hypothesis, run a statistical test on the data. It is recommended you keep the test simple, such as a t-test or a basic central tendency measure. Be sure the statistical test you use correlates to the question being asked. Describe and define the data set, the question, and the hypothesis. Identify the test selected and your reasoning for its selection. Run the analysis and generate the output. Summarize your findings and any assumptions or limitations to your analysis.

Based on your results, prepare a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the results of your research and statistical analysis of the data. In addition, within your presentation, provide a discussion of how statistics is used in organizational data mining and the role of statistics in predictive analysis.

Length: 10-15 slides (include speaker notes on each slide of at least 150 words per slide)

References: A minimum of 4 scholarly sources

Your presentation should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
