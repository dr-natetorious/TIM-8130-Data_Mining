# Section 2: Week 3: Data Mining Techniques Through Analysis and Algorithms

There are three types of data mining analysis techniques that are used to analyze the data. Classification analysis is an emerging data mining technique. In this technique, data analysis is conducted to retrieve essential information and also relevant information about the data and metadata. In this analysis, the data is classified into different classes that allow data to be clustered and segmented into useful classes. The classification analysis technique uses algorithms to determine who the data should be classified.

A second analysis is clustering analysis. In this technique, the data becomes a collection of data objects and puts these objects into the same clusters. The objects are similar to each other within the same group and are not similar to other objects in other clusters. The clustering analysis allows organizations to determine the association between two objects or set of data. Clustering analysis is often used in customer profiling.

The final data mining technique analysis is the regression analysis. The regression analysis uses statistics to identify and analyze the relationships between the variables of data. Organizations often use regression analysis in order to understand the characteristics of their customers that impact other variables and changes among the customers. Regression analysis is often used for prediction and forecasting.

Rules that imply association relationships among a set of objects in a database are called association rules. You can discover association rules at several levels of abstraction given a relevant set or sets of data in a database. For example, you can identify a set of symptoms that occur together with a disease and then follow up to study why this is the case.

The concept of association has attracted many areas including selective marketing, decision support, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting. The mining of these association rules can require iterative scanning of large databases of many types and can be costly in processing power to the machine running the algorithms. Finding efficient ways to mine rules in large databases is an area of substantial research.

SQL server data mining includes the following algorithm types:

- Classification algorithms predict one or more discrete variables based on the other attributes in the dataset.
- Regression algorithms predict one or more continuous numeric variables, such as profit or loss, based on other attributes in the dataset.
- Segmentation algorithms divide data into groups, or clusters, of items that have similar properties.
- Association algorithms find correlations between different attributes in a dataset. The most common application of this kind of algorithm is for creating association rules, which can be used in a market basket analysis.
- Sequence analysis algorithms summarize frequent sequences or episodes in data, such as a series of clicks in a website or a series of log events preceding machine maintenance.

The resources for this week will explore data mining algorithms. As you would expect, these algorithms are complex; and a great deal of research goes into the final product. The readings for this week explore how the algorithms are created and used within the data mining process.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
