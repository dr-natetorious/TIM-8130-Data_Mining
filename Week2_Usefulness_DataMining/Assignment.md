# Evaluate Data Mining Techniques to Optimize a Data Set

Creating huge data sets from scratch is virtually impossible. Data built up over time take years to accumulate. However, you can practice the concepts of data mining using a tool as simple as Excel. Excel has some basic data optimization tools built into it that can be used called Solvers.

Part 1: Locate an Excel tutorial with sample data that instructs on how to create a spreadsheet model. Then use the Solver to optimize the data. Turn in a copy of the Excel spreadsheet with a Word document containing screenshots with explanations of how you completed the tutorial. Finally, you should include a paragraph after the screenshots in which you explain how the optimization improved performance.

Part 2: Analyze the processes that you used in Part 1. Consider the organization that you used for the Week 1 assignment and compare the data mining techniques of big data used in the organization and the process that you used. Discuss how big data presents challenges for the organization and their data mining techniques. How can these challenges and limitations of current data mining techniques impact the organization and its ability to use big data?
