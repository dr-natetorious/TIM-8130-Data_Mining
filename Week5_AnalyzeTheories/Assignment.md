# Analyze Data Mining Theories Through Data Problems

## Identify a Research Question

Part 1: Select a dataset that is publicly available on the Internet, such as the Census Bureau, any government database, any of the databases used in this class or in prior courses to date, or any nonprofit databases that are publicly available. Using the data set, identify a research question that you want to study. Using the dataset you located, review the type of data that is included in the set. Then, think of a possible research question, using the data provided, that you may want to ask and then research. Then, use at least two variables and an n value of 20 for each variable to run analysis and draw conclusions based on the data. Be sure that you answer your research question in your analysis.

## Investigate the Research Question

Part 2: For Part 2, you will research and answer the research question that you posed in Part 1. Your research should be centered on data mining theories and how these theories have guided organizations in the data mining processes.
