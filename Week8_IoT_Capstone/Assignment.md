# Evaluate IoT and Data Mining

## Instructions

IoT, particularly in manufacturing, has opened up an entirely new set of data collection methods that are providing the fastest-paced amount of data we have seen to date. In this final culminating assignment, you will use the information you have learned from the past seven weeks to produce a report on the use of data mining techniques and IoT.

### Section I: Business Use Case

1. First, identify a company that is using IoT as some integral part of their business.
2. Then, identify data that are collected and ways in which the company acts on the information.
3. Identify elements that have been automated as well as those that still require manual input by an employee.
4. Identify the business goal and additional information that the company may find useful to collect as it moves forward with its IoT initiative.

### Section II: Components and Resources

1. Document the hardware and personnel that are needed to complete work in this space and make assumptions about the capacity to describe potential needs in the future.
2. Identify at least two types of logic components or assumptions that must be built into the process

### Section III: Evaluation of ROI

1. at least two statistical techniques that can be used to determine whether the IoT process is resulting in the expected return on investment.
2. Be sure you source and thoroughly describe each component.

### Section IV: Future of IoT and Data Mining

1. Finally, research data mining techniques and corresponding theories that relate to the use of IoT and how this new trend will impact data mining research in the future.
