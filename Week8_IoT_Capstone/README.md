# Section 3: Week 8: Future of Data Mining

Businesses have adopted the processes of data mining in order to make critical business decisions. Data mining has proven to be a key step for the organization to evaluate the quality of the data and to understand the patterns of the data. One of the latest trends in data mining is multimedia data mining. This technique involves extracting data from different multimedia sources. These include audio, video, hypertext, and images. The data from these sources is then turned into numerical formats for analysis purposes. Clustering and classifications can be used in these techniques.

Another huge trend in data mining is the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a relatively new concept. All applications from IoT will raise the scale of data even further than it has already gone. Devices and with coffee machines are loosely connected. The trillions of connected devices will generate massive amounts of data—even by today’s standards—and there will be valuable information in those data that could be used to improve our daily lives and make the world a better place. The challenges to taking advantage of this data are algorithmic design, business models, and system capabilities.

IoT is moving into the manufacturing world. Known as IoT in Manufacturing, the technology is creating smart manufacturing with companies such as IBM, AT&T, Microsoft, and SAS leading the way.

The industries most likely to use IoT in manufacturing are those with high costs in warehousing, shipping, logistics, fabrication, document management, assembly, and packaging. Many of the routine, mundane tasks being performed by individuals are being sourced to machines—oftentimes robots and equipment help make decisions quickly, order parts if needed, replace equipment when necessary, and optimize plants and processes.

Combining the IoT, manufacturing, and data mining can produce staggering results for businesses. The results of data mining will help organizations to be profitable in the business-related decisions that are made. Data mining will allow marketing and advertising to target more customers with greater levels of precision. In the near future, data mining will likely become as common as sending emails to organizations. Tools will become readily available for organizations to use; and more organizational leaders will understand the benefits of big data, data mining, and statistical concepts.

The resources for this week focus on the future of data mining. With technology changing almost daily, the way data mining is used will also continue to develop.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
